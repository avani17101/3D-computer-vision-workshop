    "#### Note on conventions\n",
    "In mathematical notation, the convention is tha data matrices are column-indexed, which means that a input data $x$ has shape $[d, n]$, where $d$ is the number of dimensions and $n$ is the number of data points, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages have a slightly different convention. Data matrices are of shape $[n, d]$. This has the benefit of being able to access the ith data point as a simple `data[i]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that you need to be careful about your handling of matrix dimensions. For example, while the covariance matrix (of shape $[d,d]$) for input data $x$ is calculated as $(x-u)(x-u)^T$, while programming you would do $(x-u)^T(x-u)$ to get the correct output shapes."
